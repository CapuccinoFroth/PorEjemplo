# PorEjemplo - Utility, NFTs, Rewards

**Learn and earn - “Por Ejemplo” Web3 dApp**

**Project’s Objective:** Is a Web3 platform utilizing Game-Fi token incentivization and Social-Fi content-data where users can earn while they learn a language and tutors can earn for their unique content creation. Given it’s open source, developers can also implement gamification features and offer additional rewards to encourage user engagement. In parallel AI will also be used to feed the language data and translations. 

**Sector:** Incentivize language learners and foster a community of language enthusiasts with positive reinforcement + rewards.

**The platform:** The dApp will be a user-friendly platform where learners can access language courses, exercises, quizzes, assessments and in-game items such as puzzles/crosswords. You can collaborate with language experts and teachers to create high-quality content for the dApp.

**Rewards system:** The dApp will have a reward system built in, where learners can earn tokens for completing language learning tasks, such as taking quizzes, participating in discussions, and practicing with native speakers. The tutors will earn by creating content for the learner. Developers can earn by creating in-game types such as puzzles and crosswords. The dApp will have a utility token that can then be exchanged for either ETH or SOL. It will use the NFT tokens to encode ownership of content created.

**Promoting the program:** The dApp can be promoted through social media, language learning communities, and targeted ads. We can also collaborate with language learning organizations.

**Monitoring and optimizing the program:** The dApp’s performance will be monitored for user feedback to identify areas of improvement. 


#----------------

**Tokenomics**

**Token type:** Por-Ejemplo will have a utility token (ABC) that learners can earn for completing language learning tasks. Developers can earn by implementing language games, such as crossword or puzzles, within the platform. Tutors can earn by creating unique content. All users can earn by participating in language community activities.

**Token supply:** Set a fixed token supply to avoid inflation and ensure scarcity.

**Token distribution:** Distribute tokens to learners based on their participation and contribution to Por-Ejemplo. For example, learners can earn tokens for completing language courses, exercises, and assessments, participating in discussions, and practicing with native speakers.

**Token value:** The token ABC is a utility token that can be minted based on the activity of the participant. The participant is incentived to mint new tokens. When ABC tokens are redeemed for either ETH or SOL, the ABC token is burnt. This will reduce the token supply and increase token value.

**Reward system:** The reward system incentivizes learners to participate in the program. For example, learners can earn ABC tokens for completing specific milestones, such as finishing a language course or reaching a certain level of proficiency. Users can also earn additional rewards for participating in-games. Tutors can host language exchange sessions and earn rewards. contribute to the development of the platform.

**Token redemption:** All participants can redeem their ABC tokens for a diff crypto-currency or they can also redeem for in-app items, such as access to premium language learning content or exclusive language exchange events. Can also partner with language learning organizations to offer discounts on their products or services.

**Technical Specs**

The dApp will need to follow these technical specifications:

**Blockchain:** The platform will use the Solana blockchain infrastructure now that can be bridged to the EVM ecosystem. 

**Smart Contract:** The platform will use smart contracts to manage the token rewards for learners, tutors and devs. The smart contract should be written in RUST. 
The smart contract should have the following functions:
- Distribute tokens to tutors upon profile set up and service offer (content creation, flashcards as NFTs, private tutoring, etc)  
- Distribute tokens to learners upon completion of profile and learning activities (quizzes, vocabulary review, play puzzles/crosswords, etc).
- Distribute tokens to developers  upon completion of profile and in-game app creation such as puzzles/crosswords.
- Keep track of the number of tokens earned by each user
- Enable the transfer of tokens from one user to another. This can also be used to give a tip, a thank you or a congratulation to a user. 

**Token:** The utility token for reward mechanism will be called ABC. The ABC token can then be redeemed/exchanged for SOL. The NFT Tokens can be created by content creators. These can be collected by the learner.  

**Wallet Integration:** The dApp will be initially integrated with Phantom as it supports SOL. As a phase 2 it will integrate with MetaMask. This integration will allow users to receive and transfer tokens.

**Learning Content Management:** We will need to use/develop a content management system that will manage the learning content. The CMS should have the following features:
- Create and manage courses
- Create and manage learning activities such as quizzes, assignments, and projects
- Track the progress of learners
- Track the content of tutors
- Award tokens to learners upon completion of learning activities

**User Interface:** We will need to develop a user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly. 
The UI should have the following features:
- Register participants (tutors, learners, devs) and their wallet addresses.
- Display available courses and learning activities
- Display the number of tokens earned by participants
- Enable participants to transfer tokens to other participants
- Provide user support through various channels such as email and chat.


#----------------

**NFT:**

- Unique content gets created into an NFT.
- NFTs can be rented/sold in a marketplace peer-to-peer.
     - Other teachers or students want to use this material. 
- Tutoring marketplace
     - Improve audio and conversation skills with a 1-1 participant and get/give rewards. (peer to peer)
- Flashcards (and cheat-sheets) can be NFTs… then rent it out for others to use for their studies.
- Certificate of completion, as an NFT to proof you completed a course. 
- You can buy an e-book (NFT) and rent it out.
- Have Avatar characters.

**In-game digital goods**

- Create or play word puzzle, crossword games.
- Can use an avatar (NFT) as your character.

**Wireframing in Figma:** [WIP]:
To help visualize the design, structure and layout of the platform. Currently using Figma.
